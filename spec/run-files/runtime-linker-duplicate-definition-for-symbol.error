GHCi runtime linker: fatal error: I found a duplicate definition for symbol
   HUnitzm1zi2zi5zi2_TestziHUnitziBase_zdwzdcshowsPrec_slow
whilst processing object file
   /home/maksenov/.cabal/lib/HUnit-1.2.5.2/ghc-7.6.2/HSHUnit-1.2.5.2.o
This could be caused by:
   * Loading two different object files which export the same symbol
   * Specifying the same object file twice on the GHCi command line
   * An incorrect `package.conf' entry, causing some object to be
     loaded twice.
GHCi cannot safely continue in this situation.  Exiting now.  Sorry.
